AI War Game

Overview

This project is an AI-driven war game where two teams of soldiers engage in combat in a dynamic, non-fixed way. The game runs multiple iterations, using a security map and pathfinding algorithms to simulate strategic movements.

Features

AI-Controlled Soldiers: Each soldier makes decisions based on risk factors and available cover.

Security Map: Dynamically updated risk assessment of the battlefield.

Pathfinding Algorithm: Modified A* algorithm that avoids high-risk areas, BFS for searching enemies around the map and limited BFS to find optimal cover in war zone

Grenades & Bullets Simulation: The game simulates grenade explosions and bullet trajectories, impacting the security map.

Adaptive Strategy: Soldiers adjust their movements based on changing battlefield conditions.
